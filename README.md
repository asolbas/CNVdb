# CNVdb
Statistical analysis, annotation and functional enrichment analsysis of the FJD CNV database of allele frequencies

### Roadmap
The files contained in this repository are: 
- VennDiagram.R: statistical and exploratory data analysis of the database. 
- DensityPlot.R: tools for the data visualization of the distribution of the genomic regions contained in the database. 
- split_matrix.py: divides of the data base of CNVs in two: one for duplications and another for deletions. 
- run_AnnotSV.sh: bash script to annotate the regions of the CNV data base. 
- genes.R: statistical analysis of the genes annotated int the database. 
- GO_v2.R, KEGG_v2.R, InterPro_v2.R and HPO_v2: functional annotation of the genes mapped to the regions of the CNV database and enrichment analysis.
