# CNVdb
Statistical analysis, annotation and functional enrichment analsysis of the FJD CNV database of allele frequencies

### Roadmap
The files contained in this repository are: 
- __VennDiagram.R__: statistical and exploratory data analysis of the database. 
- __DensityPlot.R__: tools for the data visualization of the distribution of the genomic regions contained in the database. 
- __split_matrix.py__: divides of the data base of CNVs in two: one for duplications and another for deletions. 
- __run_AnnotSV.sh__: bash script to annotate the regions of the CNV data base. 
- __genes.R__: statistical analysis of the genes annotated int the database. 
- __GO_v2.R, KEGG_v2.R, InterPro_v2.R and HPO_v2__: functional annotation of the genes mapped to the regions of the CNV database and enrichment analysis.
